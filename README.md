# React Native Performance Experiments

Source from Wix.com https://github.com/wix/rn-perf-experiments

Various performance experiments with React Native over a swipeable card example. The same example is implemented multiple times with a pan responder, direct component manipulation, native container and Animated library.

### Running the demo

* `npm install`
* Open `ios/example.xcodeproj` in Xcode
* It's recommended to run on a real device since the simulator doesn't provide authentic results
* You may have to set your credentials under
  * `Target example - General - Identity - Team`
  * `Target example - Build Settings - Code Signing Identity`

### Simulation of stress conditions

Since this app is overly simplified, performance will probably be equally good in all 4 implementaitons. In order to feel the differences between the implementations, the following stress conditions can be simulated:

* Simulate heavy render function - a computationally-intensive block is added to the render function

* Simulate busy bridge every 1 sec - a burst of data is sent over the bridge every 1 second
